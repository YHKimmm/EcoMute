                  EcoMute is a web application that helps users compare travel
                  methods and estimated emissions for their daily commutes. By
                  inputting two locations and selecting different transportation
                  methods, users can make more informed decisions to reduce
                  their carbon footprint and make sustainable choices. Our goal
                  is to empower users to take action in promoting sustainability
                  and reducing carbon footprints.

                How Are Emission Values Calculated?
              </h3>
              <p className="pt-2 value-text text-md text-gray-300">
                EcoMute calculates estimated emissions based on various factors,
                including distance, transportation mode, and fuel type. Our data
                is sourced from reputable organizations and databases, such as
                the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the
                International Energy Agency. To estimate the emissions, we use
                the CO2 emissions from a gallon of gasoline (8,887 grams
                CO2/gallon) or diesel (10,180 grams CO2/gallon), along with the
                distance of the commute and the mileage of the vehicle. However,
                please note that these values are estimates and may not be
                entirely accurate for your specific situation.
              </p>
              <p className="pt-2 value-text text-md text-gray-300">
                Please note that the intent of this estimation is to provide a
                rough estimate for educational and awareness purposes to help
                individuals better visualize the amount of CO2 emissions from
                their daily commutes.
